`ng-react-bridge` is a lightweight Angular package designed to bridge React and Angular. It enables developers to seamlessly render React components inside Angular components using a directive, simplifying the integration of both frameworks in hybrid applications.

## Features

- Render React components within Angular templates.
- Pass props dynamically from Angular to React components.
- Lightweight and easy-to-use directive.
- Fully compatible with Angular standalone components.

## Prerequisites

- **React** (`react`)
- **ReactDOM** (`react-dom`)

Install them if they are not already present in your project:

```bash
npm install react react-dom @babel/preset-react
```

## Installation
